    # `sources/` (the bundled plugins) and `dashboard.py` must live alongside
    # the `attention` script at runtime -- it resolves both relative to its
    # own resolved file path. libexec + a symlink into bin keeps that
    # relationship intact (a symlink's target still resolves correctly),
    # rather than bin.install dropping just the one file with no siblings.
